    Rules the [DojoModerator](/DojoModerator) should explain to dojo
participants at the start, which may make your meeting run more
smoothly.

-   StartFromScratch - so everyone is up to speed, even if they weren't
    at the last meeting
-   SpeakUpIfYoureLost - so everyone understands what the pair at the
    keyboard is doing.
-   OnlyCriticiseOnGreenBar - only allow design critique/refactoring
    advice when there is a green bar.
