    an (anti-pattern, is it one?) mechanism for switching the pair at the
keyboard when doing [RandoriKata](/RandoriKata)

-   the pair is driving, looking for a solution
-   anyone in the audience may interrupt if he knows *the* solution
-   the interrupter takes over driving, the driver becomes co-pilot

In my experience, this mechanism is an anti-pattern.

Mine too, I have seen this grind a dojo to a halt as people haul the
design back and forth in competing directions. --MattWynne

I've seen it work in small doses. If the driver is lost, and someone
else knows a good solution, it can be worthwhile for the someone else to
drive. But, the decision must be made by the current driver. If they
don't want to pass the keyboard, they don't have to. --
