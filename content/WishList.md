    ### General

-   How about the ability to actually **do** a code-dojo without
    requiring any software (except a browser) installed on the computers
    of players who want to do a coding-dojo? I have built a free,
    no-advert code-dojo server to do just this as a service to the
    software community. It's called [CyberDojo](/CyberDojo) . Its url is
    <http://www.cyber-dojo.com> I've also put a screencast demonstrating
    me doing the [KataRomanNumerals](/kata/RomanNumerals) in Ruby on
    vimeo at <http://vimeo.com/15104374> (I'm
    [JonJagger](/people/JonJagger) by the way)
-   As a [DojoOrganizer](/DojoOrganizer) and
    [DojoAttendee](/DojoAttendee) , I would like effective
    PatternsOfCodingDojos to help with the details of what typically
    works and what doesn't.
-   For each kata in the catalogue, I would like to find ScreenCasts of
    what a good solving could be. (Yes, I am asking a lot --
    [ColinGarrigaSalaun](/people/ColinGarrigaSalaun) )
-   Change the rules for editing pages for just registered users that
    can edit the wiki. We have a lot of spam here.

### Software support for the dojo: user stories

-   As a programmer interested in honing my skills, I want to find out
    if there's a dojo in my area I could attend
-   As a [DojoAttendee](/DojoAttendee) , I want to know where and when
    "my" dojo is convening
-   As a [DojoOrganizer](/DojoOrganizer) , I want to schedule and
    divulge next meetings
-   As a [DojoOrganizer](/DojoOrganizer) , I would like to hear about
    good Kata exercises that other groups have tried and a summary of
    the main things to be learnt from that kata. See
    [KataCatalogue](/KataCatalogue) .
-   As a curious guy, I would like to see more photos and videos of the
    dojos happening out there.
-   As a [DojoAttendee](/DojoAttendee) and as a programmer, I wish codes
    published at the end of a session could be colorized
    (syntax colorization) -- [PhilippeBlayo](/people/PhilippeBlayo)
-   As a dojo organizer/attendee(see [DojoRoles](/DojoRoles) ), I would
    like to have an automated process to publish codes at the end of a
    session -- [PhilippeBlayo](/people/PhilippeBlayo)
