## Dojos

We organize two Dojos:

  * one for the apprentices
  * one for developers.

### Computer apprentices
In Switzerland, the profession of computer specialist can be learned through an
apprenticeship of 4 years. The educational system is dual, which mean that
apprentices have both schoolteaching and practice in enterprise.
Apprentice instructors propose they join a Dojo session to help them with their
coding problems. We usually do some `Java`, `C#`, `JavaScript` or `pyhton`.

### Computer specialists
For employees in IT fields, another session is organized. We usually coding with
`node.js` but we also do a lot of what we like to call "technological tourism" —
we try and play with trending stuffs, in a Dojo way.

## Information

As we do not have (yet) a website, the best way to gather some informations is
probably through our [GitHub](https://github.com/epfl-dojo) repository.
