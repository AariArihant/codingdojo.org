    Welcome to the Coding Dojo site-to-be.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***SEPT. 2, 2012 / NEW UPDATE.***

Greetings everyone.

It's been about a year since my previous message (see the page history
if you want to read it). I haven't enabled the edit mode back, mostly
because I have yet to find a good way to address the spam issue we've
been facing in the past. I'm still exploring ideas, might come up with
something interesting in a short while. Or not. Time will tell. What's
important for now is, I'm still here. I haven't abandoned this wiki, and
I'm still willing (more than ever, actually) to make it a place friendly
for those who want to contribute to the topic, and to keep the spammers
away. Please remain patient.

Thank you for all of you who've signaled me spam in the pages of this
wiki. I usually haven't been as reactive as I'd wished I would, but each
of your comments has been very helpful. And it signaled me that others
care about this place. Please continue to do so. I've been today going
through a major and agressive cleaning of the wiki. I don't think I've
erased anything of value, but if I did, I apologize. Be assured it
wasn't my intention.

If you want to update something on this wiki - or create new pages,
please email me. You'll find my address on my WikiPage . This is far
from perfect. But eventually we'll make it work better.

Yours,

The purpose of this wiki is to gather user stories for what the Coding
Dojo global web site should provide to its user community. The wiki will
provide "scaffolding" while the site grows in functionality to meet
these requirements.

-   [WishList](/WishList) - if we could have anything we wanted, what
    would we want from a Coding Dojo global website?

To start off, a directory of who we are and what exactly are we doing:

-   [WhatIsCodingDojo](/WhatIsCodingDojo)
-   [CodingDojos](/CodingDojos)
-   [WhosWho](/WhosWho)
-   [KataCatalogue](/KataCatalogue)
-   [MyFirstDojo](/MyFirstDojo) (some pragmatic suggestions for how a
    Dojo might work)

Programme for a workshop at XP2010 - see [KataWorkshop](/KataWorkshop)

This is a UseMod instance - You need to use [\[UseMod
