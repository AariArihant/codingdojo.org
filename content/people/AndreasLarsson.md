    "Playing Coach" at Responsive Development Technologies.

Started [CodersDojoSweden](/dojo/CodersDojoSweden) with
[ThomasNilsson](/people/ThomasNilsson) after XP2006 confernce in Oulo,
Finland. Got hooked on the idea after a midnight sun coding session!

We have run our dojo since then in Link√∂ping, Sweden. We have also tried
the concept at out customer companies with great results.

Presented the BowlingKata together with
[ThomasNilsson](/people/ThomasNilsson) as a prepared Kata at a workshop
in XP2009 in Sardinia, Italy, that was organised by
[EmilyBache](/people/EmilyBache) .
