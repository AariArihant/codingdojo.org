    Works for Iptor Konsult AB. Business card says "Java Consultant".

First Dojo was when I decided to start learning Python. The Gothenburg
Python user group, [GothPy](/dojo/GothPy) , led by
[EmilyBache](/people/EmilyBache) and Andrew Dalke, practiced TDD and
about every second gathering involves some form of Kata.

Since 2009 I've been co-hosting the JDojo@Gbg Java oriented dojo in
GothenBurG (with [EmilyBache](/people/EmilyBache) ) but also help
clients run their own Coding Dojos.
