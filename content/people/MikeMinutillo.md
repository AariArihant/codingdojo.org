    Mike is a consultant / technical team lead living in Perth, Western
Australia. He has recently been running BrownBagSession s at work and
would like to start a [CodingDojo](/CodingDojo) at work as well. In time
he'd also like to start PerthDojo . He occasionally goes by the name of
Wolfbyte. Talking about himself in the third-person make him feel weird.

So I'll quit it.

You can contact me directly at michael.minutillo@gmail.com

More info about me should eventually appear on my openid page
