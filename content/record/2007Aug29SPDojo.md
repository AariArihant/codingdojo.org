Schedule
--------

 
:   20:00 \~ 20:15 Dojo Introduction

 
:   Again we had four new members, and so we went quickly through our
    Dojo Introduction slides.

 
:   20:15 \~ 20:20 Description and Discussion of the Problem

 
:   We read the problem, which seemed fairly simple to us. We discussed
    a few approaches to solving it, such as "for each square count the
    number of bombs around it" and "for each bomb, increment the counter
    on the squares around it". We also made a small to-do list with
    steps that had to be done, so we wouldn't get lost. Then we voted
    for one of the approaches and started coding.

 
:   20:20 \~ 22:00 Coding Session

 
:   We followed the Randori style with turns of 7 minutes, mixing "new"
    members and "old" members at the front. We had a few problems with
    the language since there wasn't anybody who really knew Python at
    the meeting. We chose the "for each bomb, increment surrounding
    counters" approach, and we got very close to finishing the problem.
    The code, as usual, is available
    at groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files.

 
:   22:00 \~ 22:15 Retrospective

 
:   This time the coding session was more confused, with a lot of
    talking besides the programming pair. Some of the possible reasons
    for that were the record number of people, the lack of something to
    visually show if we are at "red" or "green" stage and undefinition
    of a moderator (our usual moderator was out of town). People didn't
    like not finishing a problem that seemed easy, and questioned if TDD
    was good in such cases. As good things, the new members enjoyed
    seeing TDD in practice and the group wnjoyed having new members.
