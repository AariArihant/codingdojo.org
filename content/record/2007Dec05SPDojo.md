Schedule
--------

 
:   20:15 \~ 22:00 Presentation and Coding Session

 
:   This session was different than usual.
    [DaniloSato](/people/DaniloSato) would be presenting a session on
    BDD with Rspec and Rails in a local Rails event (Rio On Rails) on
    the next saturday. He decided to present a demo version of his
    lecture to gather feedback from the Dojo participants. He presented
    the concept of Behaviour-Driven Development and developed a simple
    Rails application. The application allowed participants to see the
    conference program, as well as voting on each lecture (either giving
    a positive or negative feedback, digg-style). The slides
    (in Portuguese) and the code are available at
    www.dtsato.com/blog/default/?page=studying

 
:   22:00 \~ 22:15 Retrospective

 
:   The feedback from the participants were mostly related to improving
    the presentation (both slides and demo steps).
