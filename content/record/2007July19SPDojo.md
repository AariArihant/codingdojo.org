Schedule
--------

 
:   20:25 \~ 20:35 Introduction of new participants and choosing
    kata/programming language

 
:   20:35 \~ 21:15 Coding Session I

 
:   Code TDD'ed in Randori style, switching pairs every 7 minutes. In
    the beggining, the participants had a feeling of competition and
    rushed to code and finish the problem. However, the moderator tried
    to slow down the pace and reminded the group that the dojo is a
    learning experience and that the discussions and insights are much
    more valuable than finishing the problem itself. Some interesting
    discussions about TDD and Refactoring took place while the code
    was developed. Some photos were taken and are available at
    www.flickr.com/photos/dtsato/857083962/

 
:   21:15 \~ 21:25 Coffee Break + Discussions

 
:   Food and more discussions regarding some issues with the code.

 
:   21:25 \~ 21:50 Coding Session II

 
:   The group continued implementing the kata, however some discussions
    about the Randori rules were held throughout the session. The final
    code was not bad, but everyone agreed that there was room
    for improvement. The complete code can be found
    at (groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files)

 
:   21:50 \~ 22:30 Retrospective

 
:   This time the retrospective was longer and the feedback from the
    group was very valuable. Although there were more "to improve"
    post-its then "went well" post-its, everyone enjoyed the experience
    and suggested many action items that will improve our next meeting.
    These action items will be included in next meeting's reminder page
    at [SaoPauloDojo](/dojo/SaoPauloDojo) . The overall feeling is very
    positive and everybody is looking forward to collaborate
    and participate. The results from the Retrospective can be found at
