Schedule
--------

 
:   20:30 \~ 21:40 Coding Session

 
:   Code TDD'ed in Randori style, switching pairs every 7 minutes. We
    decided to work on the same problem as last week to get used to the
    Randori style. The format worked better this time. However, we
    struggled a lot with language issues in the beggining (dealing with
    Strings, mostly). Due to the smaller number of participants, the
    pair-switching flow was smoother and it felt better. In the end, the
    code looked cleaner than last week. The complete code can be found
    at (groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files)

 
:   21:40 \~ 22:00 Coffee Break + Discussions

 
:   Food and more discussions about new ideas for the next meetings.
    Some of the interesting problems that came up were: validating
    invalid roman strings (such as "XVX", "IVX" or "IIII"); Create a
    specialized class that can handle "roman numeral" operations (like
    "III".to\_roman + 1 == 4, or III \* 2 == 6)
