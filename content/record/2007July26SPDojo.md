Schedule
--------

 
:   20:00 \~ 21:40 Coding Session

 
:   Based on the code written on the [19-Jul-2007
    meeting](/record/2007July19SPDojo) we finished the Roman
    Numerals problem. We used TDD and Randori, switching pairs every
    7 minutes. Coding flowed more easily this time, and everyone was
    satisfied with the result, which can be downloaded at
    groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files

 
:   21:40 \~ 22:00 Coffee Break + Retrospective

 
:   Food and a retrospective followed the coding session. People felt
    more confident in using the Randori style, but wondered why less
    participants came to this meeting.
