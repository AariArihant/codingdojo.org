Schedule

:   20:15 \~ 20:30 Choosing and Discussing the Problem

 
:   The Tempesta Challenge was a game developed some years ago by
    [GuilhermeSilveira](/people/GuilhermeSilveira) and PauloSilveira .
    The goal is to program a robot that has to battle other
    participant's robots in a circular arena. The last man standing is
    the winner. We decided to run the Challenge in one of our upcoming
    meetings, and this time we've chosen to implement a simple robot to
    understand the game API and to play with it, preparing our
    participants for the ultimate challenge! :-)

 
:   20:30 \~ 22:00 Coding Session

 
:   The robot was developed in Java in a [RandoriKata](/RandoriKata)
    style, switching pairs every 7 minutes. We wanted to implement a
    simple robot that moved to the center of the arena and stopped. The
    arena was built of rings that, in regular time intervals, fell off
    and made it smaller. The strategy was to stay alive, avoiding
    falling with one of the rings. The code is available
    at groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files.

 
:   22:00 \~ 22:15 Retrospective

 
:   Some of the lessons learned from the session were: we learned some
    of the API details such as its Vector representation and x, y
    coordinates; programming without tests feels unsafe. Some of the
    things that could be improved: the programming environment; the API
    documentation could be improved; we should be writing more tests;
    and we had a mysterious bug at the end of the session
