Schedule
--------

 
:   20:20 \~ 20:25 - Introduction

 
:   Two New members attended to this dojo, Welcome Danilo B. and André.
    To introduce this members to dojo, we took the 5 minutes intro.

 
:   20:25 \~ 20:33 - Choosing the Problem

 
:   As usually, five different problems were available for choice.
    "Little Bishops", "To and Fro", "Reversi" and "Go". In the past
    meetings, Little Bishops got none or just one vote, since it's
    lonely defender is not attending dojo anymore we decide to put the
    problem alway from now on. Our choice were To and Fro, a simple
    cryptographic method that given a sentence and a number it returns a
    codified message by changing the position of the characters based in
    matrix and the given number.

 
:   20:35 \~ 22:00 - Coding

 
:   We briefly discussed some design and decided the OO approach,
    basically the solution would take three steps, read data and
    represent it properly, organize data, and print decoded. As allways,
    we made the 7 minute Randori, and finished successfully the problem.
    The code is available at groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files.

 
:   22:00 \~ 22:30 - Retrospective

 
:   We took a different retrospective method, instead of two sides to
    put post-it ("What i have learned" and "What i do not like") we had
    5 divisions to put post-it ("What I want to Continue", "What i want
    +","What i want -","What o want to start","What I want to stop").
    The main discussion of this meeting was the "over kill" of the
    suggested OO Aproach by Danilo, since it was a very simple problem,
    people was questioning if it was really necessary.
