Schedule
--------

 
:   20:15 \~ 20:30 Discussing the Problem

 
:   The problem was the same as last meeting's. Last time we were not
    able to finish, so we decided to solve it again, as a
    [PreparedKata](/PreparedKata) . The approach this time was to use a
    brute force backtracking algorithm.

 
:   20:30 \~ 22:00 Coding Session

 
:   The problem was solved in Ruby, using Rspec and Rbehave. This time
    we also recorded a screencast of the meeting, that will be available
    to whoever is interested in watching how a Coding Dojo session
    is conducted. The code is available
    at groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files.

 
:   22:00 \~ 22:15 Retrospective

 
:   Some of the lessons learned from the session were: a lot of
    Ruby/Rspec /Rbehave ; the greedy algorithm was not enouhgh to solve
    this NP-complete problem; the concepts of a Story vs. a Spec; the
    approach of starting with a solution recognizer before moving on to
    the solver itself. On the other side, this was the meeting with the
    fewer number of participants (5) and without food. We hope
    everything goes back to normal on the next meeting.
