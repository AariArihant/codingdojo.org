Schedule
--------

 
:   20:15 \~ 20:30 Choosing and Discussing the Problem

 
:   After we decided to solve the Sokoban problem, we started discussing
    about it. We should not focus on an algorithm to actually solve a
    given level, but actually build a command interpreter and the game
    engine to simulate a Sokoban game. We agreed on the conventions for
    the symbols used to represent each item in a Sokoban level such as :
    the man, a box, a storage, an empty floor, and walls.

 
:   20:30 \~ 22:00 Coding Session

 
:   The problem was solved in Python in a [RandoriKata](/RandoriKata)
    style, switching pairs every 7 minutes. We came up with a TO DO list
    of things to implement. At the end of the Randori session, we were
    not able to finish the Kata, but it was possible to parse a level,
    walk and detect invalid movements. The code is available
    at groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files.

 
:   22:00 \~ 22:15 Retrospective

 
:   Some of the lessons learned from the session were: some Python
    tricks (such as using list comprehensions and split); it was
    difficult to start coding and the problem was not as simple as it
    seemed; it was good to have our red/green gadget working again. Some
    of the things that could be improved: we would be able to finish if
    we had more time; there was a lot of talking in red; some people
    suggested a more object-oriented paradigm to tackle the problem.
