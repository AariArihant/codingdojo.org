Schedule
--------

 
:   20:15 \~ 20:20 Choosing the Problem

 
:   This time the problem was chosen quickly. We decided to solve the
    Grid Folding problem from Ruby Quiz.

 
:   20:20 \~ 22:00 Discussing the Problem

 
:   Instead of trying to simulate the paper folding using Arrays, we
    decided to discuss different approaches to the problem. It was quite
    interesting to see how other people think and different strategies
    for tackling the problem. Due to the rich discussion, we didn't have
    time to start coding. There seems to be interesting maths under
    this problem. In fact, there are a lot of studies in the area
    (origami math). Another interesting aspect of the metting was how
    the participants self-organized to discuss the problem: in the
    beggining, I was exploring the problem by simulating some scenarios
    on the black board. After a while, some participants decided to step
    up and try different approaches in the black board. In the end, we
    were all standing up, discussing different things in parallel,
    mostly working in pairs.

 
:   22:00 \~ 22:15 Retrospective

 
:   After the meeting, we decided to do our usual retrospective. The
    feedback was overall very good, altough we didn't have time to
    actually code. Everyone enjoyed the discussion and the
    food (pizzas!). Some people suggested that this problem could be a
    good candidate for a [PreparedKata](/PreparedKata) in the
    next meeting.
