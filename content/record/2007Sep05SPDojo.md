Schedule
--------

 
:   20:00 \~ 20:20 Discussion of the Kata

 
:   This time [DaniloSato](/people/DaniloSato) and
    [MarianaBravo](/MarianaBravo) presented a
    [PreparedKata](/PreparedKata) . In the beginning, the problem was
    presented and the group discussed an overall approach to solve it.
    The problem involved creating and bi-coloring a graph with *n*
    People nodes and *m* Friendship edges.

 
:   20:20 \~ 22:00 Coding Session

 
:   This was the first time we tried to present a
    [PreparedKata](/PreparedKata) using pair programming. Also, the
    discussion and suggestions from the audience were helpful and raised
    some important issues. We were able to finish the code, using a
    Breadth-First Search algorithm, using a queue. The test cases helped
    us tackle the problem step by step. The final code is available
    at groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files.

 
:   22:00 \~ 22:15 Retrospective

 
:   For the first time, we had an international guest at our session:
    NateAune (www.nateaune.com), member of the Plone Foundation. He came
    to Brazil to present at Pycon and we invited him to experience TDD,
    pair programming, and the Dojo. It was also nice to solve a graph
    search algorithm with TDD. People were felling a little confused
    with the results from the last meeting, and experiencing the
    [RythmOfTestFirst](/RythmOfTestFirst) work was rewarding. Another
    nice thing was to use [FabricioSousa](/FabricioSousa) 's Tk GUI that
    showed a nice colored bar that was updated every time the tests
    were executed. It helps the audience to know when we're at a red or
    green bar.
