Schedule
--------

 
:   20:20 \~ 20:50 Choosing and Discussing the Problem

 
:   Today we had some problems with the environment and spend some time
    configuring it. After that, we decided to vote which problem we
    would solve. We decided to solve a problem from RubyQuiz , called
    "Splitting the Loot". Since this is an NP-complete problem, we spend
    more time discussing the different approaches to solve it.

 
:   20:50 \~ 22:00 Coding Session

 
:   We tackled the problem in a [RandoriKata](/RandoriKata) style,
    programming in Python and switching pairs every 7 minutes. Once
    again, some environment issues slowed us down. By the end of the
    meeting, we were not able to solve the problem, but we thought it
    would be a good candidate for a [PreparedKata](/PreparedKata) in the
    next meeting. The code is available
    at groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files.

 
:   22:00 \~ 22:15 Retrospective

 
:   Some of the lessons learned from the session were: some Python
    syntax (list slice, and range with parameters); the discussion was
    good (although it took some of our implementation time) and the
    challenge was fun (harder algorithm). On the other side, we think we
    can improve our environment and we need more time to program. To
    find a good balance between discussion time and implementation time
    is hard when the difficulty level of the problem changes.
