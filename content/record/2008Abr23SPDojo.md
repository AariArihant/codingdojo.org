Schedule
--------

 
:   20:00 \~ 21:00 Discussing the Problem

 
:   The problem was presented by one of the participants, who proposed
    an aditional challenge of developing an algorithm that would run in
    time O(n lg n). The other participants were interested in the
    challenge, and we discussed a few approaches to the problem. For
    each approach, we tried to understand if it would meet the
    additional restriction and why. Some very interesting suggestions
    came up and we also learned what that restriction really means.
    After discussing the approaches, we settled on trying to implement
    one of them, based on divide and conquer strategies.

 
:   21:00 \~ 22:00 Coding Session

 
:   During the coding session, we started by testing and implementing
    the structure of a skyline. We didn't get very far since problem
    discussion took up so much time. What a dilema! We also managed to
    change pairs more "time-boxedly", that is, we respected the 7 minute
    timer for Randori a little better that usual. This makes the meeting
    more dynamic and fast paced, and we enjoyed it.

 
:   22:00 \~ 22:15 Retrospective

 
:   We enjoyed the discussion of approaches, but regreted having less
    time to code - a dilema we don't yet know how to solve. We used the
    C Dojo Tests that has been remade by
    [HugoCorbucci](/people/HugoCorbucci) (he owes us a Kata of it, but
    he has little time to prepare it), and it is improving. We still
    want a lot more things, though! Someone pointed out that doing TDD
    in a familiar language like C makes it easier to undestand what TDD
    really is. Unfortunately we still got problems with the Makefile,
    but we don't really want to solve them during the meetings. We have
    improved a bit the level of conversation in the audience, but it is
    still a problem. We also don't like that we haven't posted last
    week's meeting report yet.
