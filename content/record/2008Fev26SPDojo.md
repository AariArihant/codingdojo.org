Schedule
--------

 
:   20:15 \~ 20:30 Choosing and Discussing the Problem (as Usual)

 
:   20:30 \~ 22:00 Coding Session

 
:   The problem started as a [RandoriKata](/RandoriKata) with
    [FabricioSousa](/FabricioSousa) presenting the start of his solution
    and the audience involving on it later on, switching every 7 minutes
    as usual. The problem evolved until we reached a test where the
    greedy solution wouldn't solve anymore. Then we stopped coding to
    explain what was the problem (longest path search) and why it is a
    NP-complete problem. This leaded to the discussion about what was
    the brute force solution to it and [MarianaBravo](/MarianaBravo)
    wrote down a pseudocode on the board with the audience that seemed
    to solve the problem. We didn't have time to code it. However the
    code produced is available
    at groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files.

 
:   22:00 \~ 22:15 Retrospective

 
:   Some of the lessons learned from the session were: shortest path is
    easy, longest path is not. NP-complete problems are usually solved
    by brute force recursively (resulting in a neat small code).
