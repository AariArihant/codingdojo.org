Schedule
--------

 
:   20:15 \~ 20:30 Choosing and Discussing the Problem (as Usual)

 
:   20:30 \~ 22:00 Coding Session

 
:   The problem was solved in Ruby with Rspec in a
    [RandoriKata](/RandoriKata) style, switching pairs every 7 minutes.
    We thought that the problem was solved by the end of the session,
    but when running an integration test (with the sample input from the
    problem description page) it didn't work. We had no time during the
    meeting to investigate further. Some decided to solve it again and
    present it as a [PreparedKata](/PreparedKata) in a future session.
    The code is available at groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files.

 
:   22:00 \~ 22:15 Retrospective

 
:   Some of the lessons learned from the session were: a lot of ruby and
    rspec; some people found it interesting to use pending specs as a
    todo list of the implementation steps we had in mind after the
    design discussion. Some of the things that could be improved: we
    discussed the importance/relevance of keeping a session recap in
    this wiki; some scribes said that the "template" is always the same
    and that not all information should be logged.
