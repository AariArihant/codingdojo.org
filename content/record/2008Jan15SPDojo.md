Schedule
--------

 
:   20:15 \~ 20:30 Choosing and Discussing the Problem (as Usual)

 
:   20:30 \~ 22:15 Coding Session

 
:   The problem was solved in Ruby with Rspec in a
    [RandoriKata](/RandoriKata) style, switching pairs every 7 minutes.
    One of the main themes of this meeting was the use of mocks (and
    rspec's mocking framework). Many people didn't know about this
    concept and it was very helpful to test the collaboration of our
    object with Ruby's time and random methods. The problem was solved,
    as the three main requirements of the problem were implemented. The
    code is available at groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files.

 
:   22:15 \~ 22:30 Retrospective

 
:   Some of the lessons learned from the session were: a lot of ruby and
    rspec, specially mocks. Some of the things that could be improved:
    we decided that the output of a session's retrospective was usually
    being lost between meetings. We decided to post here a list of the
    action items we need to act upon for next week's session.
