Schedule
--------

 
:   20:00 \~ 21:00 Choosing the Language and Setting up the environment

 
:   21:00 \~ 22:15 Coding Session

 
:   The problem was solved in Lua with lunit in a
    [RandoriKata](/RandoriKata) style, switching pairs every 7 minutes.
    Since nobody had any previous experience with Lua, it was a really
    painful experience. We struggled mostly with the language, the API
    and unit testing. We hardly had time to really implement the hard
    part of the problem. Just some shy start of it. The code is
    available at groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files.

 
:   22:15 \~ 22:30 Retrospective

 
:   Some of the lessons learned from the session were: lunit and lua are
    not that easy to catch. Trying a new language if NOBODY knows
    anything about it is not a good idea. Language changes should be
    started by a Kata demonstration to get attendees started on
    the matter.

Action Items for Next Meeting
-----------------------------

**Action Item (Responsible)**

-   Preparing a Kata in a new language. First Kata presented should
    define the next dojo language.
