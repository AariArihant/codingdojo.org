Schedule
--------

 
:   20:15 \~ 20:30 Choosing and Discussing the Problem (as Usual)

 
:   20:30 \~ 22:15 Coding Session

 
:   The problem was solved in Smalltalk with SUnit using Squeak. It
    worked in a [RandoriKata](/RandoriKata) style, switching pairs every
    7 minutes. The main discussion was around how operations could be
    represented alike in pre, post and infix notation. We discussed how
    to build a tree operation and what was the differnce between prefix
    notation and postfix notation. Then it was easy to see it all
    involved building up a tree and making the right search on it. Spent
    the rest of the time coding the Tree in Smalltalk. The code is
    available at groups.google.com/group/dojo\_sp/files but requires
    Squeak V3.9 to be run.

 
:   22:15 \~ 22:30 Retrospective

 
:   Some of the lessons learned from the session were: a lot fo
    Smalltalk (since few attendees knew it) and how to write any
    expression in pre, post or infix notation (or any other) by the use
    of a binary tree. Actions regarding next session were to have a
    simpler problem for new languages and, if possible, a Kata to
    demonstrate its use.
