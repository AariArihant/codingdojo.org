Schedule
--------

 
:   20:15 \~ 20:30 Choosing and Discussing the Problem (as Usual)

 
:   20:30 \~ 22:15 Coding Session

 
:   We create some basic functions such as assert\_true and
    assert\_equals using C. Testing the Unit with it's own test was
    pretty nice, and the whole thing about double negation and boolean
    logic gave a certain problem at first. We ended the coding part of
    the session with such a good set of tools that we can keep building
    it as we need it on further sessions.

 
:   22:15 \~ 22:30 Retrospective

 
:   Some of the lessons learned from the session were: Pre-compilation
    directives of C such as \#define, \#ifndef; How a Unit Test is
    build; boolean logic could be not so trivial to understand; and to
    use metaphors to explain complex things (Creative Whack Pack).
