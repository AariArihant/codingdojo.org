Schedule (times are innacurate)
-------------------------------

 
:   20:00 \~ 20:15 Introduction of new members and dojo presentation.
    Choosing problem.

 
:   We'll settle on C as a language for a while, because jumping between
    languages no one knows doesn't get us anywhere. We're also using, of
    course, our own developed C Unit Tests "framework".

 
:   20:15 \~ 20:40 Problem discussion

 
:   We explained the problem and discussed a few approaches. We drew the
    possible commands of the block world on the board, to help us
    understand them.

 
:   20:40 \~ 22:00 Coding Session

 
:   We spent some minutes preparing the Makefile (no one really
    remembered how to do it and we got some errors), and then
    started coding. The Dojo C Tests worked fine, but we found some
    feature requests - possibly for future meetings. We started by what
    seems to be the most tricky operation (pile over) and we managed to
    finish a part of it.

 
:   22:00 \~ 22:20 Retrospective

 
:   Some of the highlights from the retrospective:

 
:   \* We don't know how to test that our program frees allocated memory

 
:   \* We learned to write and use a Makefile, despite the difficulties
    with it

 
:   \* We had a complaint about the programming environment: mac
    shortcuts are odd and the editor we used wasn't very good

 
:   \* We enjoyed using C for a change and we liked very much to use our
    own "Dojo C Tests". We have feature requests for it.

 
:   \* We liked having new people

Action Items for Next Meeting
-----------------------------

-   Try to configure a new environment for programming, with a normal PC
    and editor
